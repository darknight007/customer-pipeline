Your organization’s marketing team wants to send biweekly scheduled emails to customers that are expected to spend above a variable threshold. This is the first ML use case for the marketing team, and you have been tasked with the implementation. After setting up a new Google Cloud project, you use Vertex AI Workbench to develop model training and batch inference with an XGBoost model on the transactional data stored in Cloud Storage. You want to automate the end-to-end pipeline that will securely provide the predictions to the marketing team, while minimizing cost and code maintenance. What should you do?

This project aims to create a scheduled pipeline on Vertex AI Pipelines that accesses the data from Cloud Storage, uses Vertex AI to perform training and batch prediction, and outputs a file in a Cloud Storage bucket that contains a list of all customer emails and expected spending.
